**Which statement about application control is true?**

- Application control uses the IPS engine to scan traffic for application patterns.
- ~~Application control is unable to scan P2P architecture traffic.~~

FortiGates can recognize network traffic generated by a large number of applications. Application control sensors specify what action to take with the application traffic. Application control uses IPS protocol decoders that can analyze network traffic to detect application traffic, even if the traffic uses non-standard ports or protocols. Application control supports traffic detection using the HTTP protocol (versions 1.0, 1.1, and 2.0).

**Which statement about application control in an NGFW policy-based configuration is true?**

- Applications are applied directly to the security policies.
- ~~The application control profile must be applied to firewall policies.~~

Profile-based next-generation firewall (NGFW) mode is the traditional mode where you create a profile (antivirus, web filter, and so on) and then apply the profile to a policy.

In policy-based NGFW mode, you allow applications and URL categories to be used directly in security policies, without requiring web filter or application control profiles.
