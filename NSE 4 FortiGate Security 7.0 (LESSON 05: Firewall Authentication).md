- FortiToken Mobile

FortiToken is available as either a mobile or a physical (hard) token. Mobile tokens can be purchased as a license, or consumed with points as part of the FortiToken Cloud service. FortiToken Mobile and physical FortiTokens store their encryption seeds on the cloud. FortiToken Mobile seeds are generated dynamically when the token is provisioned. They are always encrypted whether in motion or at rest.
